# Order Management API

## Description
This project provides a RESTful API for managing orders in a SQL database. It allows clients to create, retrieve, update, and delete orders. Built using ASP.NET Core, this API demonstrates best practices in handling database operations and API design.

## Features
- CRUD operations for orders:
  - **Create**: Add new orders to the system.
  - **Read**: Retrieve existing orders.
  - **Update**: Modify details of existing orders.
  - **Delete**: Remove orders from the database.
- Secure and efficient database interaction with parameterized queries.
- Integration of Swagger for API documentation and testing.

## Technology Stack
- **ASP.NET Core**: For creating the web API.
- **Dapper**: As a micro-ORM to handle database operations.
- **Microsoft.Data.SqlClient**: For database connectivity.
- **Swashbuckle (Swagger)**: For API documentation.
